Description: A general purpose toolbox that consists of a set of functions
    for applied analyses in the behavioural sciences. Confidence intervals for
    standardized effect size estimates, for both fixed and random predictors,
    are generated using randomly constructed distributions and optimized through
    stochastic approximation. Sample size planning incorporates the uncertainty
    associated with effect size estimates and provides both quantiles for power as
    well as expected confidence interval width. Mediation functions provide p-values
    for the indirect effect based on the partial posterior p-value and confidence
    intervals based on hierarchical Bayesian analyses. Functions for resampling
    regression models are provided for both casewise resampling as well as the
    wild bootstrap. All regression resampling functions incorporate missing data
    functionality through multiple imputation.
